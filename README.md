# ringpuzzle

Paper Mario: The Origami King Ring Puzzle Solver in Python. This is a script that outputs the list of moves to solve any ring puzzle.

## Installation

Make sure that you have Python installed on your computer. This project also uses the numpy library. Use the package manager pip to install numpy.

```bash
pip install numpy
```
## Usage

After running the program, you will be prompted to enter the total number of enemies, followed by the 'ring' and 'slice' of each enemy, and finally the number of ring moves. Rings are indexed from outermost ring to innermost, starting from 0 and ending at 3. Slices are indexed from Pi radians to -Pi radians, clockwise. Indexing starts from 0 and ends at 11. Typing in a 0 for the number of enemies will pull up a preloaded puzzle board to solve as a demo.
